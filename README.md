Introduction:
WebSocialMedia is a Python-based project that analyzes social media data from Twitter. It retrieves information through the Twitter API and analyzes the data for insights on various topics.

Part 1: Twitter Trends
The project first explores the top ten trends in the UK on Twitter. It uses the Twitter API to obtain data and finds that Mino Raiola was the top trend with 700K tweets and retweets. Additionally, the project explores the use of locational data and devices. The project discovers that North America, West Europe, and India have the highest number of English language tweets, and Twitter's web app, Apple, and Android products are the most commonly used devices for tweeting. The project also analyzes verified accounts, finding that only 2.6% of users were verified.

Part 2: Ukraine
The project analyzes the most popular trends in Ukraine, which is a topic that people have been discussing frequently since Russia attacked the country. The project streams tweets globally for over eight hours, gathering over 400,000 tweets. Additionally, the project performs time analysis, finding that the busiest time for tweeting was between 12:15-12:30 AM.

Part 3: Graph Analysis
The project also analyzes graph data from Facebook using graph analytics. The dataset contains 22,470 nodes and 171,002 edges, and the project uses the networkx library from Python to analyze the data. The project explores centrality measures such as betweenness, degree, and eigenvector centrality to identify essential nodes in the graph.

Conclusion:
WebSocialMedia is an excellent tool for anyone looking to analyze social media data from Twitter. It offers insights into the most popular trends and locational data, and it can also analyze graph data. The project is an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn more about Python and social media analytics.
